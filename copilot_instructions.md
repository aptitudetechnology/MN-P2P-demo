Certainly! Here is an updated set of **GitHub Copilot instructions** that summarize the current state **and** guide Copilot through possible fixes for the `ImportError` and structural issues you've uncovered:

# GitHub Copilot Instructions: Resolve ImportError and Project Structure Issues in `models`

## Context

The application throws the following error:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Compound' from 'models' (unknown location)
```

This occurs during the line:

```python
from models import Compound, BiochemicalGroup, TherapeuticArea, Disease, Study, db
```

## Current Project State

* The `models/` directory exists but **does not contain an `__init__.py` file**.
* All five model classes (`Compound`, `BiochemicalGroup`, `TherapeuticArea`, `Disease`, `Study`) and a `db` instance are defined inside `models/models.py`.
* A separate `extensions.py` file also defines `db = SQLAlchemy()`, intended to be the shared database instance.
* There may be circular import risks due to `db` being defined in multiple places.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Make `models` an importable package

* Add an empty or populated `__init__.py` file to the `models/` directory.

### 2. Refactor the `db` instance

* Remove the `db = SQLAlchemy()` definition from `models/models.py`.
* Import the shared `db` from `extensions.py` instead:

  ```python
  from extensions import db
  ```

### 3. Expose model classes at the package level

* In `models/__init__.py`, import all model classes from `models/models.py`:

  ```python
  from .models import Compound, BiochemicalGroup, TherapeuticArea, Disease, Study
  from extensions import db
  ```

### 4. Update application imports

* Update all references like:

  ```python
  from models import Compound, db
  ```

  to work via the `models/__init__.py` proxy.

---

## Result

After these changes, the following import will work throughout the app:

```python
from models import Compound, BiochemicalGroup, TherapeuticArea, Disease, Study, db
```

and the project will follow Flask best practices for extension management and modular structure.

Let me know if you want Copilot to generate the `models/__init__.py` or update `models/models.py` to import `db` from `extensions`.
